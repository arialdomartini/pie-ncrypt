# Building from source code
## Build
Run:

```
dotnet build
```

### Run tests
Run:

```bash
dotnet test Pie.NCryptTest/Pie.NCryptTest.csproj
```

It should be possible to run tests with a simpler `dotnet test`, but I run in the issue ['dotnet test' in solution folder fails when non-test projects are in the solution #1129](http://wiki.c2.com/?PrimitiveObsession)

## NuGet package
Create the NuGet package with:

```bash
dotnet pack -c release -o .
```

Publish it with:

```bash
dotnet nuget push Pie.NCrypt/[nupkg_file] -k [apikey] -s https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json
```

replacing `apikey` with the API Key managed by the [NuGet account page](https://www.nuget.org/account/apikeys).
